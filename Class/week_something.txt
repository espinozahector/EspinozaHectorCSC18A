Abstract Class - like a blue print/ template.// cannot be instantiated
we are allowed to have member variables of any kind member functions and abstract member functions

Abstract member functions are functions that are declared but NOT implemented

Interface - cantract of public member functions that tell us what functions a program needs to work.
The implemention of our functions is up to us.
